# SeaSARR

---

This is an in depth analysis on the effectiveness of applying proposed image preprocessing techniques to object detection models trained on Synthetic Aperture Radar data.  Models are trained to detect all instances of a maritime vessel within an image, particularly in images with high Signal-to-Noise and Clutter-to-Noise ratios.
