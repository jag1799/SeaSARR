    "# Section 5 - Canny FRCNN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we utilize the OpenCV implementation of the Canny algorithm as a preprocessing layer to Faster-RCNN and analyze its performance.  Canny is a popular multi-stage edge detection algorithm designed to a) highlight the edges of all objects within an image and b) remove anything between different edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "In using this algorithm, we hypothesize that FRCNN will achieve better performance on more complex images since much of the noise of non-targets is removed and only the outline of the edges is considered.  By training on a ship's outline, which is relatively consistent regardless of ship sizes, we expect the model to identify targets in areas that previously had significant amounts of noise, such as docks, inclement weather, and other confusers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.1 - Canny Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Canny pipeline includes three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Noise Reduction**: Use Gaussian Blurring on the entire image to reduce noise surrounding edges that may lead to false positives.\n",
    "2. **Gradient Intensity**: It then uses the Sobel kernel (another Edge Detection method) in the X and Y directions to determine the gradient magnitude. Then it uses a formula to extract the gradient direction of individual pixels.\n",
    "3. **Non-Maximum Suppression**: Once edges are proposed, NMS is used to remove any pixels that may be a false positive edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on the Canny algorithm, OpenCV's documentation has a good explanation of the topic: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/da/d22/tutorial_py_canny.html"

Setting the threshold too high can remove key target details or even entire targets. Using a value too small will not remove enough noise and can reduce model performance.  As we see in the below figures, (200, 100) is not a high enough threshold to clear much of the noise from the shoreline, inevitably leading to misclassifications."
