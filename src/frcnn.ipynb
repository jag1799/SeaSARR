    "# Analysis Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes a general overview of the dataset by (1) preparing your workspace to use the dataset in the COCO format, (2) visualizing a few images from one of the datasets for information purposes, and (3) conducting an analysis on modifications made to the Faster R-CNN model.  The dataset used is the SARscope dataset found at the below link.  The objective of this project is to determine whether proposed image processing methods would increase the performance of different models on Synthetic Aperture Radar data of maritime vessels.\n",
